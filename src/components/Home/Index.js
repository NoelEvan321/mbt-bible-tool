        <p>The purpose of this app is to bring the Word of God to the world. We believe that every word in the Bible was 
            was perfectly placed by a perfect God. As such, we should not use our lives to understand the Word, but rather
            use the Word to understand our lives. The Word of God must be used to explain the Word of God.

            We at Midtown Baptist Temple study the Word to know what God intends for His people to learn from specific passages.
            To understand God's intent, we study to understand the words God uses and why He uses them where He uses them. 
            The MBT Bible Tool is a user friendly application designed for the modern user. This tool is intended to be used by any
            believer wanting to know what God wishes to say to His people through His word. 
            While the eventual goal is to reach all believers at all stages of faith, this tool is currently in testing and will be for the use of LFBI students
            and LFFellowship members only. 
            This tool offers a modernized experience and advanced analytics designed to aid and guide a believer in the 'Discovery Bible Method'
